# SprintBoard Component Documentation

## Overview

The `SprintBoard.js` file contains a React component that implements a Kanban-style board for managing sprint tasks. It's a key part of the project's task management functionality, allowing users to visualize and manage tasks across different stages of development.

## Component: SprintBoard

This component renders a drag-and-drop sprint board using react-beautiful-dnd, Material-UI components, and React Query for data fetching and state management.

### State

- `columns`: An object representing the columns of the sprint board, each containing a title and an array of task items.

### Hooks

1. `useQuery`: Fetches tasks from the API.
2. `useMutation`: Handles updating tasks when they are moved between columns.
3. `useEffect`: Organizes fetched tasks into the appropriate columns.

### Main Functions

#### `onDragEnd`

Handles the logic when a task is dragged and dropped.

**Parameters:**
- `result`: Object containing drag and drop information.

**Functionality:**
- Updates the local state of columns.
- Triggers a mutation to update the task status on the server if the task is moved to a different column.

#### `getPriorityColor`

Determines the color of the priority chip based on the task's priority.

**Parameters:**
- `priority`: String representing the task priority.

**Returns:**
- A string representing the Material-UI color to use for the chip.

### Rendering

The component renders a grid of columns, each representing a stage in the sprint process (e.g., To Do, In Progress, etc.). Each column contains draggable task cards displaying task information.

## Usage

This component is likely used in the main application layout to display the sprint board. It should be wrapped in a parent component that provides the necessary context and routing.

Example:

```jsx
import SprintBoard from './components/SprintBoard';

function SprintPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Current Sprint</h1>
      <SprintBoard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Dependencies

- React
- react-beautiful-dnd
- @mui/material
- react-query
- ../services/apiService (for `fetchTasks` and `updateTask` functions)

## Project Context

This component is part of a larger project structure:

- It's located in the `src/components` directory, indicating it's a reusable component.
- It relies on API services defined in `src/services/apiService.js`.
- It's likely used in conjunction with other components like `Backlog.js` and `TaskCard.js` to form a complete task management system.

## Notes

- The component uses React Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
- It implements a responsive design using Material-UI's Grid system.
- Error and loading states are handled gracefully.
- The drag-and-drop functionality allows for intuitive task management.

This component plays a crucial role in the project by providing a visual and interactive interface for managing sprint tasks, enhancing the overall productivity and organization of the development process.
