## Features

-   Backlog: Manage and prioritize your project tasks
-   Sprint Board: Visualize and track progress during sprints
-   Generate prop types always
-   Task Cards: Detailed view for individual tasks
    -   title
    -   description
    -   points
    -   priority

## Planned Enhancements

-   User Authentication: Implement secure login and user management
-   Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Enhance user experience for task management
-   Search and Filter: Add advanced search capabilities for tasks

## Design Considerations

-   Modular Component Architecture: Ensures reusability and maintainability
-   Context API: Manages global state for authentication and theme
-   Service Layer: Abstracts API calls for better separation of concerns
-   Theming: Utilizes a centralized theme for consistent styling

Here's my prioritized product backlog and recommendations for the JIRA Clone project:

### 1. Prioritized Features for Next Sprint

1. **Implement Backlog Ordering**

    - Allow users to reorder tasks in the backlog using drag-and-drop
    - Add an 'order' property to tasks and persist the order
    - Explanation: This is a core feature for any project management tool and will significantly
      improve usability

2. **Persist Task Updates**

    - Ensure that task updates (status, description, etc.) are saved and remembered
    - Implement proper state management and API calls
    - Explanation: Currently, changes aren't persisting, which is a critical bug affecting user
      experience

3. **Add Comments to Tasks**

    - Implement a comment system for tasks
    - Allow users to view and add comments in the task view
    - Explanation: This feature enhances collaboration and communication within the team

4. **Improve Sprint Board Functionality**

    - Update task status when dragged to different columns (e.g., QA)
    - Persist these status changes
    - Explanation: This will make the Sprint Board more interactive and useful for tracking progress

5. **Enhance Task Update UX**
    - Modify the update task flow to close the task window upon successful update
    - Ensure the UI reflects the changes immediately
    - Explanation: This will provide better feedback to users and improve the overall user
      experience

### 2. Potential New Features or Improvements

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**

    - Implement a proper login system
    - Add user roles and permissions

2. **Reporting and Analytics**

    - Add basic reporting features like burndown charts or velocity tracking

3. **Integration with Version Control**

    - Allow linking tasks to Git commits or pull requests

4. **Custom Fields for Tasks**

    - Let users add custom fields to tasks for more flexibility

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**
    - Optimize the UI for mobile devices

### 3. Risks and Concerns

1. **Data Persistence**: The current issues with saving updates suggest there might be underlying
   problems with state management or API integration.

2. **Performance**: As more features are added, especially with drag-and-drop functionality, we need
   to ensure the application remains performant.

3. **User Adoption**: Without proper onboarding or intuitive design, users might find it difficult
   to transition from JIRA to this new tool.

4. **Scalability**: The current architecture might need review to ensure it can handle additional
   features and increased user load.

### 4. Recommendations for the Development Team

1. **Code Quality**:

    - Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
    - Set up continuous integration to run these tests automatically

2. **State Management**:

    - Consider using a robust state management solution like Redux or MobX

3. **API Integration**:

    - Review and potentially refactor the `apiService.js` to ensure proper data handling

4. **UI/UX Improvements**:

    - Conduct user testing to identify pain points in the current interface
    - Consider implementing a design system for consistency

5. **Documentation**:
    - Improve inline code documentation
    - Create technical documentation for the project architecture and key components

By focusing on these priorities and addressing the identified concerns, we can significantly improve
the JIRA Clone project and set a strong foundation for future enhancements.
