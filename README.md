## Design Considerations

-   Modular Component Architecture: Ensures reusability and maintainability
-   Service Layer: Abstracts API calls for better separation of concerns
-   Theming: Utilizes a centralized theme for consistent styling
-   State Management: Consider implementing Redux or MobX for robust state handling
-   Performance Optimization: Implement lazy loading and code splitting

## Technical Improvements

-   Set up continuous integration and deployment pipeline
-   Optimize API integration and data fetching strategies
-   Implement proper error handling and logging
-   Enhance security measures (e.g., input validation, XSS protection)
