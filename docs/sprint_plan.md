Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal

Implement core AI-driven features to enhance project management capabilities and improve user
productivity.

## Selected User Stories/Tasks

### High Priority

1. Implement AI-generated backlog (13 story points)

    - Integrate AI model for task suggestion
    - Create UI for AI-generated task review and approval
    - Implement API endpoint for AI task generation

2. Develop Epics feature (8 story points)

    - Create Epic model and database schema
    - Implement Epic creation and management UI
    - Allow tasks to be associated with Epics

3. Implement AI epic detection (13 story points)
    - Develop algorithm to group related tasks into potential Epics
    - Create UI for reviewing and confirming AI-detected Epics
    - Implement API endpoint for AI Epic detection

### Medium Priority

4. Enhance task dependencies and subtasks (5 story points)

    - Implement subtask creation and management
    - Develop UI for visualizing task dependencies
    - Update task model to support dependencies and subtasks

5. Implement team collaboration features (8 story points)
    - Add user mentions functionality in task comments
    - Develop shared dashboards for team members
    - Implement real-time notifications for task updates

### Low Priority

6. Enhance search functionality with advanced filters (5 story points)

    - Implement complex search queries with multiple criteria
    - Develop UI for building and saving custom search queries
    - Create API endpoints to support advanced search operations

7. Implement WebSocket for real-time updates (8 story points)
    - Set up WebSocket server
    - Update frontend to use WebSocket connections for live data
    - Implement real-time collaboration features (e.g., simultaneous editing)

## Estimated Effort

Total story points: 60

## Dependencies and Risks

1. AI model integration may require additional research and potential third-party services.
2. Epic detection algorithm accuracy may need fine-tuning based on user feedback.
3. WebSocket implementation may introduce complexities in deployment and scalability.
4. Team collaboration features may require updates to the existing user management system.
