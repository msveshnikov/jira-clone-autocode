Based on the current project state and recent developments, here's an updated product backlog:

# Updated Product Backlog

## High Priority

1. Implement backlog ordering functionality
   - Allow tasks to be reordered by drag-and-drop
   - Persist task order in backend/localStorage
   - Update UI to reflect new order

2. Fix task update functionality
   - Ensure changes are saved and persisted when updating a task
   - Close task window after successful update

3. Implement persistent task status
   - Store task status in localStorage
   - Retrieve and display correct status on page reload

## Medium Priority

4. Add comments functionality to tasks
   - Display existing comments in task view
   - Allow users to add new comments
   - Implement backend/mock API for comment storage

5. Update task status when dragging in Sprint view

   - Add animations for smoother user experience

## Completed Items

- ~~Basic project structure setup~~
- ~~Initial components creation (Backlog, Header, SprintBoard, TaskCard)~~
- ~~Mock API service implementation~~

## Additional Notes

- Consider implementing a more robust state management solution (e.g., Redux) as the application grows in complexity
- Explore integrating real-time updates using WebSockets for collaborative features
- Plan for future scalability by considering microservices architecture for backend implementation

This updated backlog reflects the current state of the project, prioritizing the immediate needs such as fixing existing functionality and implementing core features. It also includes medium and low priority items for future development, as well as notes on potential architectural considerations.
