Based on the current project state and recent developments, here's an updated product backlog:

# Updated Product Backlog

## High Priority

1. Implement Sprint start and end dates
   - Add date fields to Sprint model
   - Update Sprint creation/editing UI
   - Display dates in Sprint row

2. Enhance task reordering functionality
   - Implement automatic reordering of tasks within the same sprint/backlog
   - Ensure proper order updates when a task's order is changed

3. Implement search functionality
   - Create /search route in React
   - Develop Search component
   - Implement server-side search API
   - Display search results as small task cards

4. Enhance project user management
   - Implement user add/delete functionality for project owners
   - Create API endpoint to fetch all users
   - Update Projects component to include user management

## Medium Priority

5. Optimize API integration and data fetching
   - Implement efficient data loading strategies
   - Consider using GraphQL for more flexible queries

6. Enhance security measures
   - Implement proper input validation
   - Add XSS protection
   - Set up rate limiting and request throttling

7. Implement error handling and logging
   - Create consistent error handling across the application
   - Set up a logging system for better debugging and monitoring

8. Optimize database queries
   - Implement indexing for frequently accessed fields
   - Optimize complex queries for better performance

## Low Priority

9. Set up monitoring and alerting systems
   - Implement application performance monitoring
   - Set up alerts for critical errors and performance issues

10. Enhance mobile responsiveness
    - Optimize layouts for various screen sizes
    - Implement touch-friendly interactions for mobile devices

11. Implement internationalization (i18n)
    - Set up infrastructure for multiple language support
    - Create language files for key application text

## Completed Items

- ~~Basic project structure setup~~
- ~~Initial components creation (Backlog, Header, SprintBoard, TaskCard)~~
- ~~Mock API service implementation~~
- ~~Implement backlog ordering functionality~~
- ~~Fix task update functionality~~
- ~~Implement persistent task status~~
- ~~User authentication (basic implementation)~~

## Additional Notes

- Consider implementing WebSockets for real-time collaborative features
- Plan for a comprehensive automated testing strategy (unit, integration, and e2e tests)
- Explore performance optimization techniques such as code splitting and lazy loading
- Keep monitoring user feedback for potential new features or improvements

This updated backlog reflects the current state of the project, prioritizing the specific tasks mentioned in the TODO section of the README. It also includes optimization and security enhancements as medium priority items. Some previously high-priority items have been marked as completed, and new features have been added based on the project's evolution and immediate needs.
