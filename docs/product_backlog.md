- Consider implementing a comprehensive automated testing strategy (unit, integration, and e2e tests)

This updated backlog reflects the current state of the project, prioritizing core features like user authentication and enhanced drag-and-drop functionality. It also includes new items such as search and filter capabilities and mobile responsiveness optimization. Some previously high-priority items have been marked as completed, and new features have been added based on the project's evolution and user needs.
