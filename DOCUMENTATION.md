## Project Overview

The JIRA Clone is a lightweight project management tool inspired by Atlassian's JIRA, built with React and featuring a mocked backend. It aims to provide essential project management functionalities in a user-friendly interface.

### Key Objectives

- Provide a simplified alternative to JIRA for small to medium-sized teams
- Offer core project management features with a focus on ease of use
- Demonstrate modern React development practices and architecture

## Architecture

The project follows a modern React application architecture, leveraging functional components and hooks. It's built on top of Create React App for simplified setup and configuration.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI) 6
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Routing**: React Router 6
- **API Calls**: Axios
- **Data Fetching**: React Query
- **Drag and Drop**: react-beautiful-dnd
- **Charts**: react-apexcharts
- **Code Formatting**: Prettier
- **Linting**: ESLint

### Project Structure

├── components/      # Reusable UI components
├── context/         # React Context for global state
├── services/        # API and external service integrations
├── utils/           # Utility functions and helpers
├── App.js           # Main application component
└── index.js         # Application entry point
```

## Module Interactions

1. **App.js**: Serves as the main container, handling routing and layout.
2. **components/**:
   - `Backlog.js`: Manages the project backlog view
   - `Header.js`: Renders the application header and navigation
   - `SprintBoard.js`: Displays the current sprint board
   - `TaskCard.js`: Represents individual task items
3. **context/AuthContext.js**: Manages user authentication state
4. **services/apiService.js**: Handles API calls to the backend
5. **utils/theme.js**: Defines the application's theme and styling constants

## Features

1. **Backlog Management**: Prioritize and manage project tasks
2. **Sprint Board**: Visualize and track progress during active sprints
3. **Task Management**: Create, update, and delete tasks with detailed information
4. **User Authentication**: Secure login and role-based access control (planned)
5. **Customizable Workflows**: Define custom statuses and transitions (planned)
6. **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate sprint burndown charts and velocity tracking (planned)

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/jira-clone.git
   cd jira-clone
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Navigating the Application**:
   - Use the header navigation to switch between Backlog and Sprint Board views
   - Click on individual tasks to view and edit details

2. **Managing Tasks**:
   - Create new tasks using the "Add Task" button
   - Drag and drop tasks between columns to update their status
   - Edit task details by clicking on a task card

3. **Sprint Planning**:
   - Move tasks from the Backlog to the Sprint Board to plan your sprint
   - Adjust task priorities and estimates as needed

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Style**: 
   - Follow the ESLint configuration for consistent code style
   - Run `npm run lint` to check for linting errors
   - Use `npm run format` to automatically format code using Prettier

2. **Component Structure**:
   - Create functional components using hooks
   - Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
   - Use prop-types for type checking

3. **State Management**:
   - Use local state (useState) for component-specific state
   - Leverage Context API for global state management
   - Consider using React Query for server state management

4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for utility functions and components
   - Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical business logic

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for task cards
2. Add unit tests for components and services
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
4. Develop native mobile apps for iOS and Android
5. Implement full-text search and advanced filtering
6. Add time tracking features
7. Enable file attachments for tasks
8. Optimize performance for large datasets
9. Implement real-time collaboration features
10. Integrate with version control systems
11. Create a customizable dashboard
12. Improve accessibility features
